# Proejct-1-DLND-Simple-Neural-Network-For-Bike-Sharing

This is my first project assignment for Udacity Deep Learning Foundation Nano Degree. 
The jupyter notebook contains my implementation of a 2-layer neural network to predict bike share with the data from
[UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
The neural network is completely implemented in python numpy.<br />
Please feel free to play with it. 

#Instructions to run the jupyter notebook
1. Plese install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)/[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) on your computer first.
2. Create a new conda environemnt in the local directory where you download this repository:
```conda create --name dlnd python=3```
