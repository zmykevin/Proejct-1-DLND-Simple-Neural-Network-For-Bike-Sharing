# Proejct-1-DLND-Simple-Neural-Network-For-Bike-Sharing

This is my first project assignment for Udacity Deep Learning Foundation Nano Degree. 
The jupyter notebook contains my implementation of a 2-layer neural network to predict bike share with the data from
[UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
The neural network is completely implemented in python numpy.<br />
**Please feel free to play with it and leave your comments.** 

#Instructions to run the jupyter notebook
1. Plese install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)/[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) on your computer first.
2. Create a new conda environemnt in the local directory where you download this repository:<br />
```conda create --name env_name python=3```
3. Enter your new environemnt:<br />
  * Mac/Linux: ```source activate env_name```
  * Windows: ```activate env_name```
4. Install a list of necessary libraries, including `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `jupyter notebook`. The command is as following: <br />
```conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook```
5. Run the following command to open up the jupyter notebook in your browser:
```jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb```
6. Follow the instructions in the notebook to play with it.
